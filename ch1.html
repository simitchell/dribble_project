                    There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and
                    loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day
                    she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food.
                </p>
                <p class="storytext">
                    So she called all seven to her and said, "Dear children, I have to go into the
                    forest, be on your guard against the wolf, if he comes in, he will
                    devour you all - skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often
                    disguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice
                    and his black feet."</p>
                <p class="storytext">
                    The kids said, "Dear mother, we will take good
                    care of ourselves, you may go away without any anxiety."" Then the old
                    one bleated, and went on her way with an easy mind.
