                    When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his
                    legs, and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he
                    wanted to go to a well to drink.  But when he began to walk and move
                    about, the stones in his stomach knocked against each other and
                    rattled.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="storytext">
                    Then cried the Wolf, "What rumbles and tumbles against my poor
                    bones?  I thought 'twas six kids, but it feels like big stones."  And
                    when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the
                    heavy stones made him fall in, and he had to drown miserably.

                    <p class="storytext">
                    When the seven kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried
                    aloud, "The wolf is dead!  The wolf is dead!" and danced for joy round
                    about the well with their mother.
