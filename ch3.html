                So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked
                at it and said, "Open the door for me, children, your dear little
                mother has come home, and has brought every one of you something back
                from the forest with her."  
                </p>
                <p class="storytext">
                The little kids cried, "First show us your
                paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother."  Then he put
                his paws in through the window, and when the kids saw that they were
                white, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door.
                But who should come in but the wolf they were terrified and wanted to
                hide themselves.  One sprang under the table, the second into the
                bed, the third into the stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth
                into the cupboard, the sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh
                into the clock-case.  
                </p>
                <p class="storytext">
                But the wolf found them all, and used no great
                ceremony, one after the other he swallowed them down his throat.  The
                youngest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one he did not
                find. When the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off,
                laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began
                to sleep.  
                </p>
                <p class="storytext">
                Soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the
                forest.  Ah.  What a sight she saw there.  The house-door stood wide
                open.  The table, chairs, and benches were thrown down, the
                washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts and pillows were
                pulled off the bed.  She sought her children, but they were nowhere
                to be found.  She called them one after another by name, but no one
                answered.  
                </p>
                <p class="storytext">
                At last, when she caame to the youngest, a soft voice
                cried, "Dear mother, I am in the clock-case."  She took the kid out,
                and it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others.
                Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.
