                At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with
                her.  When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree
                and snored so loud that the branches shook.  She looked at him on
                every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his
                gorged belly.  
                </p>
                <p class="storytext">
                "Ah, heavens," said the goat, "is it possible that my poor
                children whom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still
                alive?"  Then the kid had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle
                and thread and the goat cut open the monster's stomach, and hardly
                had she make one cut, than one little kid thrust its head out, and
                when she cut farther, all six sprang out one after another, and were
                all still alive, and had suffered no injury whatever, for in his
                greediness the monster had swallowed them down whole.  
                </p>
                <p class="storytext">
                What rejoicing
                there was.  They embraced their dear mother, and jumped like a sailor
                at his wedding.  The mother, however, said, "Now go and look for some
                big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast's stomach with them
                while he is still asleep."  Then the seven kids dragged the stones
                thither with all speed, and put as many of them into his stomach as
                they could get in, and the mother sewed him up again in the greatest
                haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once stirred.
