                <p class="storytext">
                    It was not long before some one knocked at the house-door and called,
                    "Open the door, dear children, your mother is here, and has brought
                    something back with her for each of you."
                </p>
                <p class="storytext">
                    But the little kids knew that it was the wolf, by the rough voice.
                    "We will not open the door," cried they, "You are not our mother.
                    She has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough, you are the wolf."
                </p>
                <p class="storytext">
                    Then the wolf went away
                    to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this
                    and made his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the
                    door of the house, and called, "Open the door, dear children, your
                    mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of
                    you."
                </p>
                <p class="storytext">
                    But the wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and
                    the children saw them and cried, "We will not open the door, our
                    mother has not black feet like you, you are the wolf."
                </p>
                <p class="storytext">
                    Then the wolf ran to a baker and said, "I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over
                    them for me." And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to
                    the miller and said, "Strew some white meal over my feet for me."
                <p class="storytext">
                    The miller thought to himself, "The wolf wants to deceive someone", and
                    refused, but the wolf said, "If you will not do it, I will devour you."
                    Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him. Truly,
                    this the way of mankind.
